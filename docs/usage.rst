MolSym is an open-source Python package for handling molecular symmetry.
Features of MolSym include:

*   Point group detection
*   Molecule symmetrization
*   Symmetry element, irreducible representation, irreducible representation matrices, and character table generation for arbitrary point groups
*   Symmetry adapted linear combinations for internal coordinates, Cartesian nuclear coordinates, spherical harmonic basis functions, and Cartesian basis functions
